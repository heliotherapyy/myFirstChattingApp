During this sprint, we focused on these implementations.

* Allow users to create rooms and enter existing rooms - Rooms are defined by the `.roomname` property of messages, so you'll need to filter them somehow.
* Allow users to 'befriend' other users by clicking on their user name
* Display all messages sent by friends in bold
* Styling that looks as close as possible to an actual Twitter feed.

Use "bower install" if you want to test the prototype
